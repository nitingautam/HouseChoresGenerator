# Random Chores Generator

This program was created for the BeaverHacks Summer 2018 Hackathon. It is a random chores generator that helps track and divvy up weekly household chores for an individual or household through the use of a random generator. The household users and chores are stored in a database (MongoDB) and each chore is given weights such as priority, difficult, and frequency to help divide the work equally amoung household members.
